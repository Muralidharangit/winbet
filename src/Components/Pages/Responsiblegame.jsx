          </p>

          <h2>Our Commitment to Responsible Gaming</h2>

            team is trained in responsible gambling practices and is always
            ready to assist.

          <ul>
            <li>Customizable loss and betting limits</li>
            <li>Self-exclusion features upon request via Customer Support</li>
            <li>
              Links to support organizations like GamCare, Gambling Therapy, and
              SICAD
            </li>

              their families
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Account Closure and Self-Exclusion</h2>
          <p>
            If at any point you feel the need to take a break or stop playing,
            you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Access <strong>Profile &gt; Player Protection</strong> to request
              temporary or permanent exclusion
            </li>
            {/* <li>
              Contact our Customer Support at{" "}
              <a href="" className="text-info">
                support@ {APP_NAME}.in
              </a>
            </li> */}
          </ul>
          <p>
            Once activated, your exclusion or account block will be effective
            immediately. Revoking a restriction will require confirmation via
            email and may take up to 7 days once the exclusion period has
            passed.
          </p>

          <h2>Tips to Maintain Control</h2>
          <p>
            To keep your gaming fun and within your limits, consider the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Treat gambling as entertainment, not a way to earn income</li>
            <li>Never try to chase losses</li>
            <li>Keep track of the time and money you spend</li>
            <li>
              Set loss limits through your account settings or with help from
              our team
            </li>
            <li>
              Take regular breaks and use self-exclusion tools when needed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can monitor your activity (deposits, withdrawals, and betting
            history) via <strong>History &gt; Transactions</strong> in your
            account. For any suspicious activity, immediately contact us and
            update your password. You are solely responsible for keeping your
            login details secure.
          </p>

          <h2>Do You Have a Gambling Problem?</h2>
          <p>
            If you're unsure whether your gambling habits are healthy, consider
            the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Has gambling interfered with work, school, or personal
              responsibilities?
            </li>
            <li>Do you gamble to avoid boredom or loneliness?</li>
            <li>Are you playing for extended periods alone?</li>
